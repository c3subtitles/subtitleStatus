0:00:15.473,0:00:20.560
Léa: Hi, everyone, I'm Léa. Here's
Mohammed, and we're going to introduce you

0:00:20.560,0:00:23.160
to Wikidata today.
Mohammed:

0:00:27.520,0:00:32.240
Yes, hi everyone. So in the
 
course of the talk, if you do have a

0:00:32.240,0:00:37.120
question, just feel free to ask them in a
 
chat. And then we are going to try and

0:00:37.120,0:00:46.960
answer them at the end of the talk. Yes.
 
So let's dive straight in. What is

0:00:46.960,0:00:50.720
Wikidata? Wikidata is a free knowledge
 
base that is based on facts and references

0:00:50.720,0:00:57.120
that anyone can edit and reuse. It is part
 
of the Wikimedia projects. And like all of

0:00:57.120,0:01:02.080
us, to start open projects, Wikipedia is
 
multilingual and has no language barriers.

0:01:03.360,0:01:08.720
Data in Wikidata is released under CC0
 
license. That means Wikidata's data is in

0:01:08.720,0:01:14.160
the public domain and it has no exclusive
 
intellectual property rights that is

0:01:14.160,0:01:21.440
applied to it. Wikidata is not a primary
 
source of information. It only aggregates

0:01:21.440,0:01:26.000
or collects structured data that is
 
already available, some of which are links

0:01:26.000,0:01:32.400
to other databases. So it is not meant to
 
be a place for original research. Wikidata

0:01:32.400,0:01:37.280
is made for humans and machines, and is
 
available for everyone to use, whether on

0:01:37.280,0:01:47.120
other Wikimedia projects or outside of it.
 
Next slide. So what is in the Wikidata?

0:01:48.640,0:01:54.880
Wikidata was launched some eight years ago
 
and was originally created to solve the

0:01:54.880,0:01:59.200
problem of unstructuredness in the plain
 
text format that information in Wikipedia

0:01:59.200,0:02:04.240
is rendered in, and also to provide a
 
central storage location where all of the

0:02:04.240,0:02:09.520
different language Wikipedias can connect
 
and talk to each other. Today, Wikidata

0:02:09.520,0:02:14.240
has since outgrown its intended purpose
 
and has become so big and successful that

0:02:15.520,0:02:21.600
it is not only, you know, the most edited
 
Wikimedia projects, Wikidata's data is now

0:02:21.600,0:02:28.160
used more outside of the project than
 
within it. There are more than 25,000

0:02:28.160,0:02:34.640
active editors. That means people who make
 
at least one edit every month. Wikidata

0:02:34.640,0:02:40.720
has used across 800+ Wikimedia projects in
 
more than 300 languages. And it's

0:02:40.720,0:02:45.600
interesting to note that the largest
 
proportion of Wikidata's items are in the

0:02:45.600,0:02:51.680
category of scholarly items comprising
 
about 30% of the whole. Next slide.

0:02:56.320,0:02:56.880
So
far,

0:02:57.760,0:03:02.960
people and bots have made more than
 
1.3 billion edits to Wikidata and created

0:03:03.760,0:03:08.880
more than 91 million items. This map you
 
see here is a visual impression of

0:03:08.880,0:03:16.400
geolocated items currently existing on
 
Wikidata. So, the bright areas are items

0:03:16.400,0:03:21.600
that have coordinates, location property
 
added as a statement. Next slide.

0:03:26.480,0:03:29.920
So
Wikidata has a vision, and what is this

0:03:29.920,0:03:37.600
vision? Wikidata's vision is to give more
people more access to more knowledge. So

0:03:37.600,0:03:42.080
Wikidata gives access to information,
regardless of the language that people

0:03:42.080,0:03:49.040
speak, because Wikidata is multilingual,
it expects translations of so-called Q

0:03:49.040,0:03:54.000
numbers into different languages. And so
doing Wikidata helps us support the

0:03:54.000,0:04:00.000
smaller Wikimedia projects better, you
know, by helping them to benefit from all

0:04:00.000,0:04:04.240
of the work that the bigger projects are
doing. And applications and projects

0:04:04.240,0:04:08.080
outside of Wikimedia are also able to
benefit from the linked datasets in

0:04:08.080,0:04:15.600
Wikidata. So in a nutshell, Wikidata can
be thought of as an online repository of

0:04:15.600,0:04:20.080
structured data that anyone can edit and
reuse. Next slide.

0:04:22.960,0:04:28.000
OK, now, how is
 
Wikidata connected to Wikipedia and other

0:04:28.000,0:04:33.040
Wikimedia project? Among other things,
 
Wikidata can assist the sister projects

0:04:33.040,0:04:38.560
with more easily maintainable infoboxes.
 
So the table at the right corner of this

0:04:38.560,0:04:43.280
article on Wikipedia is called an infobox,
 
which I'm sure you've seen before, and

0:04:43.280,0:04:48.240
Wikidata is able to retrieve content on
 
Wikidata into those infoboxes [distorted].

0:04:53.200,0:04:59.600
And for smaller language Wikipedias like,
 
you know, Catalan Wikipedia or Welsh

0:04:59.600,0:05:06.080
Wikipedia that, that readily leverages
 
Wikidata to see their content. And it is

0:05:06.080,0:05:11.120
helpful because it's, it helps to reduce
 
editing workload for volunteers.

0:05:11.920,0:05:12.560
Next
slide.

0:05:16.800,0:05:21.040
So what should we expect to see on
 
a typical Wikidata item?

0:05:23.040,0:05:26.240
Wikidata
expresses relationships in the form of

0:05:26.240,0:05:35.760
triples that use items starting with "Q"
and property starting with "P", OK, and

0:05:35.760,0:05:40.720
the item will typically be made up of at
least one statement. So in this example

0:05:40.720,0:05:44.960
you see on the screen we have two
statements about an entity called Douglas

0:05:44.960,0:05:53.680
Adams. The first statement, Douglas Adams
was educated at P69 St John's College.

0:05:54.720,0:05:59.440
What this means is that this statement is
qualified by further properties. That is

0:05:59.440,0:06:06.320
the academic major, academic degree, the
start time and then the end time and

0:06:06.320,0:06:13.040
qualifiers add more meaning to statements.
So Wikidata records not just statements,

0:06:13.040,0:06:19.200
but also their sources. And as you can see
here, this helps us to reflect the notion

0:06:19.200,0:06:26.320
of verifiability on the project so that
statements Douglas Adams was educated at

0:06:26.320,0:06:31.440
St. John's College has two open references
that points to the source of that

0:06:31.440,0:06:38.640
information. And the second statement,
Douglas Adams, Q42, was educated at P69,

0:06:38.640,0:06:46.800
Brentwood School, only has the qualifiers
start time and end time, and it has no

0:06:46.800,0:06:53.120
references, so a single statement consists
of a property that is made up of a value

0:06:53.680,0:07:01.840
with or without a reference or with or
without qualifiers. Next slide.

0:07:06.960,0:07:07.840
So a
 
typical

0:07:07.840,0:07:12.000
Wikidata item looks like this, and
you can edit by clicking on the edit

0:07:12.000,0:07:17.520
button, it has this pen symbol with edit
next to it. As you can see, each item has

0:07:17.520,0:07:23.520
a unique ID that is Q followed by some
number. In this case, the item Douglas

0:07:23.520,0:07:32.240
Adams has QID of Q42. And when you look at
the top, there's a termbox. We call it, we

0:07:32.240,0:07:36.960
call it the termbox at the top, at the
top, that contains the label in different

0:07:36.960,0:07:43.680
languages. A description of the items that
is more of a short phrase telling us what

0:07:43.680,0:07:48.480
the item represents. It's says here in
English that Douglas Adams is an English

0:07:48.480,0:07:53.760
writer and humorist. Then there is the
alias next to the description which, aside

0:07:53.760,0:08:00.880
from the label, tells us what the item
could also be known by here. Next slide.

0:08:05.040,0:08:09.760
So, creating a new item is as simple as

0:08:09.760,0:08:18.240
going to any page on Wikidata and clicking
 
on create a new item. And once you click

0:08:18.240,0:08:22.640
on create a new item, you get to fill in
 
the form that is asking for a label,

0:08:22.640,0:08:29.280
description and an alias and QIDs are
 
assigned automatically. Next slide.

0:08:35.680,0:08:39.840
Next
slide.

0:08:44.320,0:08:45.280
Next slide, please.

0:08:51.280,0:08:54.480
Alright, so
 
there are tools that allow us to edit

0:08:54.480,0:08:58.960
Wikidata more efficiently and make bulk
 
edits to Wikidata, such as

0:09:00.320,0:09:02.240
Quick
Statements and OpenRefine.

0:09:05.600,0:09:07.840
This goes to
 
the previous slide.

0:09:14.800,0:09:19.840
OK, yeah, right, so,
yeah, Quick Statements and OpenRefine

0:09:19.840,0:09:26.000
allow us to make automated edits and
changes to Wikidata. Other tools are

0:09:26.000,0:09:31.600
available that allow us to visualize
Wikidata's data. Some of them enhances the

0:09:31.600,0:09:36.720
user interface of Wikidata, and these
could include scripts that editors can

0:09:36.720,0:09:41.200
install or they could be gadgets that may
be enabled in your preferences settings.

0:09:41.840,0:09:55.680
Next slide.
Léa: Alright. So, um, so far, Mohammed

0:09:55.680,0:10:02.080
told you about how we describe concepts in
Wikidata, and that's what we've been doing

0:10:02.080,0:10:09.360
for the first years of the project, but in
2018, we also started storing a new type

0:10:09.360,0:10:14.720
of information in Wikidata, which is
lexicographical data, which is basically

0:10:14.720,0:10:23.200
information about words and phrases in all
kinds of languages. And so you see on the

0:10:23.200,0:10:28.240
left the data model that is a bit complex
and that's why I'm not going to get too

0:10:28.240,0:10:32.240
much into details now but we can talk
about this later. And you can see an

0:10:32.240,0:10:37.840
example on the right where we basically
describe the word "Luftballon" in German

0:10:37.840,0:10:42.400
and we indicate the language, the lexical
category and all kind of informations that

0:10:42.400,0:10:46.880
are not about the object any more, but
actually about the word and how it's

0:10:46.880,0:10:56.160
composed of two words, as we like to do in
German and things like this. So, again, if

0:10:56.160,0:10:59.680
you want to know more about this, you can
have a look at lexicographical data in

0:10:59.680,0:11:08.160
Wikidata or we can talk about it together
later in the questions, for example. So

0:11:08.160,0:11:14.080
Wikidata doesn't come alone, it comes with
a bunch of tools that have been, some of

0:11:14.080,0:11:17.440
them have been developed by the
development team of Wikidata, some of them

0:11:17.440,0:11:22.000
have been developed by the community
themselves in order to do things more

0:11:22.000,0:11:26.720
efficiently. That can be, for example,
adding data and some of the tools have

0:11:26.720,0:11:31.280
already been mentioned by Mohammed, that
can also be matching data with all the

0:11:31.280,0:11:36.640
databases, querying the data, reusing the
data. There are also a bunch of tools that

0:11:36.640,0:11:43.440
are about watching the data and watching
its quality, watching what edits have been

0:11:43.440,0:11:48.320
done recently and so on. And you can find
the page that is called Wikidata Tools on

0:11:48.320,0:11:55.840
Wikidata to discover plenty of these tools
and you can, of course, create your own.

0:11:59.120,0:12:03.920
So we mentioned that the goal of Wikidata
is to be reused by everyone, but you may

0:12:03.920,0:12:10.320
wonder who is actually reusing the data.
Well, the first reusers of Wikidata's data

0:12:10.320,0:12:16.160
is actually the Wikidata community itself,
the Wikidata editors, because all of these

0:12:16.160,0:12:22.480
items are connected. So one item can be
linked from another, the content of one

0:12:22.480,0:12:28.400
item can be reused on another and so on.
The Wikimedia project such as Wikipedia,

0:12:28.400,0:12:33.440
but not only. Wikimedia Commons,
Wikisource, almost all of the Wikimedia

0:12:33.440,0:12:39.840
projects at that point reuse part of the
data that is coming from Wikidata, and

0:12:39.840,0:12:49.040
then we have companies, from the biggest
ones to the small ones because the data is

0:12:49.040,0:12:55.440
in CC0 everyone can just reuse the content
that they need. We have, of course, public

0:12:55.440,0:13:01.840
institutions such as museums, libraries
and so on. We also have journalists and,

0:13:01.840,0:13:07.600
for example, data journalists. We have
scientists and researchers and probably

0:13:07.600,0:13:11.680
much more. And the thing is that we don't
necessarily know who's reusing the data

0:13:11.680,0:13:16.800
because it's here in the open but there
are probably many usages that we don't

0:13:16.800,0:13:21.200
even imagine. So if you're using Wikidata,
or if you would like to use Wikidata's

0:13:21.200,0:13:24.720
data, let us know, because we are always
interested to discover more.

0:13:26.880,0:13:31.600
Now, the
 
question is: How can one reuse Wikidata?

0:13:31.600,0:13:36.080
I'm going to present very quickly one of
 
the most popular way to query the data.

0:13:36.080,0:13:40.320
I'm not going to get into details right
 
now because there will actually be a

0:13:40.320,0:13:46.880
workshop at the conference in two days on
 
day three about the query service so I'm

0:13:46.880,0:13:52.880
gonna let you go there and discover more
 
about how to use it. The query service is

0:13:52.880,0:13:58.800
basically a SPARQL endpoint, SPARQL being
 
a query language where you can basically

0:13:58.800,0:14:06.000
ask questions to Wikidata and get lists or
 
visualizations as a result. For example,

0:14:06.720,0:14:12.080
here's the map of the airports of the
 
world named after the person and the color

0:14:12.080,0:14:21.200
of the dot, it represent the gender of the
 
person. Or you can make a list of country

0:14:21.200,0:14:26.560
flags that are including a sun, because if
 
the data is properly modeled in Wikidata,

0:14:26.560,0:14:32.080
you're able to describe, what are the
 
different elements that compose a country

0:14:32.080,0:14:41.600
flag? Or you can have this bubble charts
 
with the occupation of accused witches,

0:14:42.160,0:14:44.960
because why not? That's the kind of data
 
we have in Wikidata.

0:14:48.240,0:14:51.520
Now, there are other
ways, of course, to query the data, I'm

0:14:51.520,0:14:55.200
not going to get into details right now,
but if you want to talk more about this,

0:14:55.200,0:15:00.720
you can, for example, join the Wikidata
meetups that are gonna happen tomorrow. We

0:15:01.440,0:15:07.120
have dumps of the data where you can
download part of or all of the data in a

0:15:07.120,0:15:12.640
file. We have a bunch of APIs to access
the data directly from your program. And

0:15:12.640,0:15:17.920
on a Wikimedia project specifically, the
community developed a bunch of templates

0:15:18.480,0:15:25.840
that are using Wikidata's data using Lua.

0:15:26.720,0:15:31.360
And now for something a bit different,
 
Wikibase. You may have heard of it and you

0:15:31.360,0:15:36.000
may even have wondered, OK, what's the
 
difference between Wikibase and Wikidata?

0:15:36.000,0:15:41.520
Well, Wikibase is basically the software
 
powering Wikidata and, more precisely, the

0:15:41.520,0:15:48.720
MediaWiki extension that is turning
 
MediaWiki into a database. And so,

0:15:50.400,0:15:55.280
Wikibase was started to power Wikidata
 
but it also started developing on its own.

0:15:55.280,0:16:01.840
Wikidata is still for now the biggest
 
existing Wikibase instance, but people can

0:16:01.840,0:16:08.400
also install Wikibase directly on their
 
server and basically create their own

0:16:08.400,0:16:15.120
little personal or public Wikidata. And
 
the development is still ongoing, there

0:16:15.120,0:16:18.960
are all kind of super exciting features
 
coming up soon. And, for example, the

0:16:18.960,0:16:26.480
ability to connect better Wikidata and
 
your own instance of Wikibase, for

0:16:26.480,0:16:31.120
example, to be able to reuse data that is
 
already in Wikidata and to connect it to

0:16:31.120,0:16:35.840
the data that you have in your own
 
Wikibase.

0:16:40.400,0:16:43.760
So, if you're interested in
Wikidata, if you want to know more, there

0:16:43.760,0:16:48.400
are a bunch of pages that you can find.
There is a help portal, the Project Chat

0:16:48.400,0:16:52.480
is the main discussion page on the wiki
where you can interact with the other

0:16:52.480,0:16:56.080
editors, the community. It's super
important to get in touch with them if you

0:16:56.080,0:17:01.360
want to get started with Wikidata. We also
have a mailing list. We have a newsletter

0:17:01.360,0:17:06.000
that is called Weekly Summary that you can
find on wiki but also if you subscribe to

0:17:06.000,0:17:09.920
the mailing list, you will also receive
it. And then we have some accounts in the

0:17:09.920,0:17:14.160
social media, on Twitter, there is a
Facebook group, there is a Telegram, um,

0:17:14.160,0:17:19.760
that is linked from the Project Chat and
there is also an IRC channel. So you can

0:17:19.760,0:17:23.200
basically find people from the Wikidata
community everywhere.

0:17:27.920,0:17:32.560
So we are
 
approaching the end of the session, but

0:17:32.560,0:17:39.760
it's not done, we have more Wikidata
 
related sessions at the c3 in the

0:17:39.760,0:17:44.800
Wikipaka. So, for example, tomorrow you're
 
going to get an introduction to Wikidata,

0:17:44.800,0:17:49.120
specifically for journalists and
 
especially data journalists. Then in the

0:17:49.120,0:17:53.280
afternoon, we're gonna have two Wikidata
 
meetups. The first one is gonna be in

0:17:53.280,0:17:56.640
German. The second one is gonna be in
 
English. So depending on your preferred

0:17:56.640,0:18:02.640
language, you can attend one or the other
 
or both, and on day three, as I mentioned

0:18:02.640,0:18:08.960
before, we're going to have a workshop to
 
learn how to query Wikidata's data with

0:18:08.960,0:18:13.840
SPARQL. So feel free to have a look and
 
check them also in the main

0:18:14.560,0:18:16.240
schedule of
Wikipaka.

0:18:20.400,0:18:24.000
Thank you very much for
 
attending this session. These are our

0:18:24.000,0:18:30.240
contact details if you want to, to contact
 
us. And of course, you can now ask

0:18:30.960,0:18:35.040
questions, as we mentioned in the chat or
 
with the hashtag.

0:18:37.120,0:18:41.360
And we will be very
happy to answer all your questions right

0:18:41.360,0:18:46.960
now.
Herald: Thank you for your input and the

0:18:46.960,0:18:52.400
overview about Wikidata. There has been a
few question or questions already answered

0:18:52.400,0:18:58.112
by Joel in the IRC channel. One was about
the big dump of scholarly data and what

0:18:58.112,0:19:04.160
scholarly data is and how this came to be
in Wikidata. But there is one more

0:19:04.160,0:19:09.680
question from the chat right now Till asks
can I add new types of data that are not

0:19:09.680,0:19:18.080
yet tracked in Wikidata?
Léa: So I'm wondering, what do you mean

0:19:18.080,0:19:22.800
exactly by type of data? Maybe you can
give a bit more details because that can

0:19:22.800,0:19:30.080
mean a lot of things. Wikidata, the data
model of Wikidata is very flexible and

0:19:30.080,0:19:36.240
it's absolutely not set in stone. Every,
every week the community comes up with

0:19:36.240,0:19:40.800
some new ways to describe things.
Sometimes we realize that there is an area

0:19:40.800,0:19:46.080
of the world that we completely forgot to
cover, and then we create new properties

0:19:47.040,0:19:52.480
to describe, for example, a certain type
of, I don't know, of concept, certain type

0:19:52.480,0:19:58.800
of building or objects that we or
philosophical concept that we didn't

0:19:59.520,0:20:05.440
describe yet. So this is always in
movement, in action. When it comes to what

0:20:05.440,0:20:11.680
we actually call data types, which is, for
example, a string of text or a date or a

0:20:11.680,0:20:16.000
picture, we have all kind of data types
like this, this is a bit more complicated

0:20:16.000,0:20:22.480
and overall, it's quite rare that we add a
new data type and it needs a strong, like,

0:20:22.480,0:20:28.320
use case so we add that to the software. I
hope that it answer your question and if I

0:20:28.320,0:20:32.480
didn't, feel free to ask again.
Herald: Yeah, we've got a feedback. The

0:20:32.480,0:20:37.760
example Till meant was, there's a, there's
an organization or a project called

0:20:37.760,0:20:44.960
Parliamentwatch in Germany. There was one
talk earlier today where they try to track

0:20:44.960,0:20:50.480
and scrape and analyze the parliamentary
protocols. And one big issue they had was

0:20:50.480,0:20:56.000
with structural data about all the members
of parliament and how they are organized

0:20:56.000,0:21:01.680
and stuff like that. And, um, well, if I
remember correctly, there actually was a

0:21:01.680,0:21:06.080
project that tried to include the
structural data of of members of

0:21:06.080,0:21:08.160
parliament in Wikidata, if I'm not
mistaken.

0:21:08.160,0:21:16.320
Herald: Absolutely. It's a WikiProject
that is called, um, something politicians,

0:21:16.320,0:21:21.280
all politicians. I don't remember the
exact name right now, but indeed. Some

0:21:21.280,0:21:28.400
people are already working on members of
parliaments and, like, political people in

0:21:28.400,0:21:34.000
general. So it's very likely that there is
already a way to structure the data. The

0:21:34.000,0:21:39.520
best way is to contact the people directly
involved on this, on this WikiProject.

0:21:41.120,0:21:46.480
WikiProjects, by the way, are pages where
basically people who have a specific topic

0:21:46.480,0:21:50.240
of interest gather and can discuss about
the specific questions about the topic.

0:21:50.800,0:21:58.160
Um, so have a look at this, at this
project about politics and, um, yeah. Try

0:21:58.160,0:22:03.280
to see if, if anything is missing, but
generally Wikidata definitely welcome

0:22:03.280,0:22:08.640
information about about politicians, about
member of parliaments, this kind of stuff.

0:22:08.640,0:22:13.200
What we do not do, however, is store the
full, like, documents, for example, in

0:22:13.200,0:22:17.600
that case, the reports or the documents,
that belongs elsewhere. Maybe on Wikimedia

0:22:17.600,0:22:21.680
Commons, for example, if it's possible, if
the license allows it. But on Wikidata,

0:22:21.680,0:22:24.080
we'll be happy to store the metadata about
them.

0:22:25.840,0:22:30.640
Herald: Alright, Joel just posted the link
to the WikiProject, Every Politician, so

0:22:30.640,0:22:36.320
if anybody looks for Every Politician on
Wikidata, they will find the project. So

0:22:36.320,0:22:40.240
basically, the bottom line is pretty much
anything is possible in Wikidata, right?

0:22:40.240,0:22:49.360
Léa: Yeah, thank you Joel, and hi. Almost
everything. So on Wikidata, just like on

0:22:49.360,0:22:55.120
Wikipedia, we still have some criteria to
define what can get in Wikidata and what

0:22:55.120,0:23:00.880
not, because we are aware that this
knowledge base, it needs to stay quite

0:23:00.880,0:23:06.320
general and it cannot contain absolutely
everything. For example, the community

0:23:06.320,0:23:12.320
decided a while ago that they would not
create one item for each human living or

0:23:12.320,0:23:18.000
who used to live on Earth, that's just not
possible, so there are some notability

0:23:18.000,0:23:25.680
criteria that you can find in the help
pages and I would say that the level of,

0:23:25.680,0:23:30.960
like, how fine-grained data should be has
to be discussed with the community and the

0:23:30.960,0:23:35.040
good thing about having Wikibase also
available as a separate instance of

0:23:35.040,0:23:39.920
Wikidata is that if some people want to
work on a topic where they have some

0:23:39.920,0:23:43.520
information that is very, very specific
and would maybe not fit the scope of

0:23:43.520,0:23:48.000
Wikidata, they can create their own
Wikibase and then they can connect the

0:23:48.000,0:23:54.000
content with what is already in Wikidata.
So altogether, in this Wikibase ecosystem,

0:23:54.000,0:23:58.240
yes, pretty much everything is possible.
Herald: Well, the future is certainly

0:23:58.240,0:24:01.680
here, at least, with Wikidata. Thank you
again, Léa and Mohammed, for your

0:24:01.680,0:24:05.520
insightful introduction to Wikidata and
we're looking forward to more people

0:24:05.520,0:24:08.080
joining you in your efforts. Thanks for
your presentation.

0:24:08.080,0:24:20.354
Léa: Thank you. See you soon.
